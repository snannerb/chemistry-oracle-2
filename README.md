## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
build a web app that generates a random number from 0 to 100 to determine the love chemistry between two people. Give 30% higher odds to numbers 50-100. Include a prompt to enter names. Include a measure bar that leaves an explanation for every 10% increase. Use a red and dark blue user interface. Use a pixel font.  At bottom of app Include link code <a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a>   .

## Project Plan
```
Hereâ€™s a **simple and clear project plan** for building the web app based on the provided requirements. The plan includes main tasks and technical considerations.

---

## **Project Plan: Love Chemistry Web App**

### **1. Project Setup**
- **Task**: Set up the development environment.
  - Create a new project folder.
  - Initialize a Git repository for version control.
  - Set up a basic HTML file (`index.html`), CSS file (`styles.css`), and JavaScript file (`script.js`).
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use a lightweight code editor (e.g., VS Code).
  - Ensure cross-browser compatibility.

---

### **2. Design and Layout**
- **Task**: Implement the UI design.
  - Create a clean layout with:
    - Two input fields for names.
    - A button to trigger the calculation.
    - A measure bar to display the result.
    - A footer with the provided link.
  - Apply the red and dark blue color scheme using CSS.
  - Import and apply a pixel font (e.g., "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts).
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for responsive layout.
  - Ensure the design is mobile-friendly.

---

### **3. Random Number Generator**
- **Task**: Implement the biased random number generator.
  - Write a JavaScript function to generate a random number between 0 and 100.
  - Adjust the logic to ensure numbers between 50-100 have a 30% higher probability.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use `Math.random()` and custom logic to bias the results.
  - Test the function to ensure the bias works as expected.

---

### **4. User Input and Interaction**
- **Task**: Handle user input and display results.
  - Add event listeners to the button to capture user input.
  - Validate the input to ensure both names are entered.
  - Display the generated number and corresponding measure bar.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use JavaScript DOM manipulation to update the UI dynamically.
  - Add error handling for empty inputs.

---

### **5. Measure Bar and Explanations**
- **Task**: Implement the measure bar and explanations.
  - Create a progress bar or similar visual element to represent the percentage.
  - Add text descriptions for each 10% increment (e.g., "0-10%: Not a match").
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use CSS for the measure bar styling.
  - Use JavaScript to update the bar and text dynamically based on the result.

---

### **6. Footer Implementation**
- **Task**: Add the footer with the provided link.
  - Include the HTML link in the footer:
    ```html
    <a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a>
    ```
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Ensure the link opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).
  - Style the footer to match the overall design.

---

### **7. Testing and Debugging**
- **Task**: Test the app thoroughly.
  - Test the random number generator to ensure the bias works.
  - Test the UI on different devices and browsers.
  - Debug any issues with input validation, measure bar updates, or styling.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use browser developer tools for debugging.
  - Test edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, very short names).

---

### **8. Deployment**
- **Task**: Deploy the app to a web platform.
  - Host the app on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
  - Ensure the app is accessible via a public URL.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Optimize assets (e.g., minify CSS and JavaScript).
  - Test the live version to ensure everything works as expected.
